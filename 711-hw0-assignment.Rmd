# Getting Setup

Welcome to Advanced Data Science at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health! This course will focus on hands-on data analyses with a main objective of solving real-world problems. In this class, we will be using a variety of tools that will require some initial configuration. To ensure everything goes smoothly moving forward, we will setup the majority of those tools in this homework. While some of this will likely be dull, doing it now will enable us to do more exciting work in the weeks that follow without getting bogged down in further software configuration. 

For more information about the course objectives, pre-requisites, course structure and the grading policy, see the [Syllabus](syllabus.html)

# Programming expectations 

### R 

This course assumes knowledge of and experience working with the R programming language. There are many great tutorials for learning R including some listed on the [Resources](https://jhu-advdatasci.github.io/2019/resources.html) course page. 

Install the latest version of R from [https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org). 

### RStudio 

Install the latest version of RStudio Desktop (Open Source Edition) from [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). 

### Hello, R Markdown 

This is an R Markdown document. It is based on _markdown_, a markup language that is widely used to generate html pages. You can learn more about markdown [here](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). 

The idea behind R Markdown is that it is _literate programming_, which weaves instructions, documentation and detailed comments in between machine executable code, producing a document that describes the program that is best for human understanding (Knuth 1984). Unlike a word processor, such as Microsoft Word, where you what you see is what you get, with R markdown you need to _compile_ the document into the final report. The R markdown document looks different than the final product. This seems like a disadvantage at first, but it is not at all because, for example, instead of producing plots and inserting them one by one into the word processing document, the plots are automatically added. 

The reason we will use R Markdown in a data analysis course, is because it allows you to write reports, incorporating text and code into a single document. This is important because the final product of a data analysis is often a report. Many scientific publications can be thought of us a final report of a data analysis. The same is true for news articles based on data, an analysis report for your company, or lecture notes for a class on how to analyze data. The reports are often on paper or a PDF that includes a textual description of the finding along with some figures and tables resulting from the analysis. Imagine after you finish the analysis and the report, you are told that you were given the wrong dataset, You are sent you a new one and you are asked run the same analysis with this new dataset. Or what if you realize that a mistake was made and need to re-examine the code, fix the error and re-run the analysis? Or imagine that someone you are training wants to see the code and be able to reproduce the results to learn about the approach? Situations like the ones just described are actually quite common for a data scientist. 

Read through the RStudio R Markdown tutorial here: [https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html). Make sure you are comfortable with [how to render an R Markdown document](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html), [code chunks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html) and the [parameters](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-6.html) you can use for the code chunks. 

### Installing R packages

Next, we will install some packages that we'll need in the first few lectures. First, we will install the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org). 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(tidyverse)
```

Notice, there is a parameter `eval=FALSE` in the code chunk above. If you knit this document, that code chunk will not be evaluated. However, you can execute the line of code in RStudio to install the set of R packages in the tidyverse. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

We can use the `sessionInfo()` function in the next code chunk to print out information in the current R session. 

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```


# Homework 0 Assignment

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/monty_hall_2x.png)

Here's a fun and perhaps surprising statistical riddle, and a good way to get some practice writing R functions.

## The Monty Hall Problem

In a gameshow, contestants try to guess which of 3 closed doors contain a cash prize (goats are behind the other two doors). Of course, the odds of choosing the correct door are 1 in 3. As a twist, the host of the show opens a door after a contestant makes his or her choice. This door is always one of the two the contestant did not pick, and is also always one of the goat doors (note that it is always possible to do this, since there are two goat doors). At this point, the contestant has the option of keeping his or her original choice, or swtiching to the other unopened door. The question is: is there any benefit to switching doors? The answer surprises many people who haven't heard the question before.

We can answer the problem by running simulations in R. We'll do it in several parts.

#### Problem 1

First, write a function called `simulate_prizedoor(nsims)` with the argument `nsims` representing the number of simulations to run. The output should return a set of integers (1s, 2, 3s) representing hiding a prize behind door 1, door 2 and door 3. The length of the returned object should be `nsims`. This function will simulate the location of the prize in many games.

```{r}
## add your code here

## There are more elegant ways to write that; the following way is the most basic and may not have optimal performance
simulate_prizedoor <- function(nsims){
  ans <- rep(NA, nsims)
  for (i in 1:nsims) {
    temp <- runif(1)
    if (temp <= 1/3){
      ans[i] <- 1
    }
    else if (temp >= 2/3){
      ans[i] <- 3
    }
    else {ans[i] <- 2}
  }
  return(ans)
}
```

#### Problem 2

Next, write a function that simulates the contestant's guesses for `nsims` simulations. Call this function `simulate_guess()`. This function should return any strategy for guessing which door a prize is behind. This could be a random strategy, one that always guesses 2, whatever. Include the `nsims` as an argument of the function. The output should return a set of integers (1s, 2, 3s) representing the guess for the contest, whether the prize is behind door 1, door 2 or door 3. The length of the returned object should be `nsims`. 

```{r}
## add your code here 

## Here I would do a random strategy that gives predictions among door 1, 2 and 3.
## I will choose to write that in another way; without using for loops it shall work better

simulate_guess <- function(nsims){
  ans_1 <- rmultinom(nsims, size = 1, prob = c(1,1,1))
  temp <- t(as.matrix(c(1,2,3))) %*% ans_1
  ans <- as.vector(temp)
  return(ans)
}
```

#### Problem 3 

Next, write a function, `goat_door()`, to simulate the opening of a "goat door" that doesn't contain the prize, and is different from the contestants guess. Here, there should be at least two arguments: one representing the set of integers for which is the prize door and a second representing the set of integers for which door the contestant guessed in each simulation. 

```{r}
## add your code here
## this is related to both the reality and the guess
## sp: simulated prize
## sd: simulated door guessed by the player
goat_door <- function(sp, sd){
  ans <- rep(NA, length(sp))
  for (i in 1:length(sp)){
    if (sd[i] == sp[i]){
      temp = setdiff(c(1,2,3), sd[i])
      if (runif(1) <= 0.5){
        ans[i] <- temp[1]
      }
      else {ans[i] <- temp[2]}
    }
    else{ans[i] <- setdiff(c(1,2,3), c(sd[i], sp[i]))}
  }
  return(ans)
}
```

#### Problem 4 

Write a function, `switch_guess()`, that represents the strategy of always switching a guess after the goat door is opened. 

```{r}
## add your code here
## sg: simulated door guessed by the player
## gd: goat door
switch_guess <- function(sg, gd){
  ans <- rep(NA, length(sg))
  for (i in 1:length(sg)){
    ans[i] <- setdiff(c(1,2,3), c(sg[i], gd[i]))
  }
  return(ans)
  
}
```

#### Problem 5 

Calculate the percent of correct guesses out of `nsims` using the strategy of switching and the strategy of staying with the first choice made. 

```{r}
## add code here 
## let nsims = 10000
## Set seed first
set.seed(123)
nsims <- 10000

## Simulation begins here
Correct <- simulate_prizedoor(nsims)
Stay <- simulate_guess(nsims)
Switch <- switch_guess(Stay, goat_door(Correct, Stay))

## Correct Rate
Rate_stay <- mean(Correct == Stay)
Rate_Switch <- mean(Correct == Switch)

## Correct rate for staying ~ 1/3
Rate_stay
## Correct rate for switching ~ 2/3
Rate_Switch



```

Most people find this result surprising the first time they hear about the game. Let's explore this a bit more. 

#### Problem 6

Generalize the functions to allow for more than 3 doors. This will help us understand why opening a goat door affects the odds of winning. For example, let's say there are 100 doors in the game now with still only one prize and 99 doors with goats behind them. You pick one door and the host opens 98 other doors after you made your initial selection. Would you want to keep your first pick or switch? 

```{r}
## add code here 
## Let's say there are 100 doors
## Let me write code for that

simulate_prizedoor_100 <- function(nsims){
  ans_1 <- rmultinom(nsims, size = 1, prob = rep(1, 100))
  temp <- t(as.matrix(seq(1, 100, by = 1))) %*% ans_1
  ans <- as.vector(temp)
  return(ans)
}

## For choosing for a correct gate randomly
## Basically the same function
simulate_guess_100 <- function(nsims){
  ans_1 <- rmultinom(nsims, size = 1, prob = rep(1, 100))
  temp <- t(as.matrix(seq(1, 100, by = 1))) %*% ans_1
  ans <- as.vector(temp)
  return(ans)
}

## Open the goat doors
## Opening 98 other doors
goat_door_100 <- function(sp, sd){
  ans <- matrix(rep(NA, length(sp) * 98), nrow = 98)
  for (i in 1:length(sp)){
    if (sd[i] == sp[i]){
      temp = setdiff(seq(1,100), sd[i])
      ans[,i] <- sample(temp, size = 98, replace = FALSE)
    }
    else{ans[,i] <- setdiff(seq(1,100), c(sd[i], sp[i]))}
  }
  return(ans)
}


## Results for switching
switch_guess_100 <- function(sg, gd){
  ans <- rep(NA, length(sg))
  for (i in 1:length(sg)){
    ans[i] <- setdiff(seq(1,100), c(sg[i], gd[,i]))
  }
  return(ans)
  
}

## And let's see what will happen
set.seed(1234)
nsims <- 100000

## Simulation begins here
Correct_100 <- simulate_prizedoor_100(nsims)
Stay_100 <- simulate_guess_100(nsims)
Switch_100 <- switch_guess_100(Stay_100, goat_door_100(Correct_100, Stay_100))

## Correct Rate
Rate_stay_100 <- mean(Correct_100 == Stay_100)
Rate_Switch_100 <- mean(Correct_100 == Switch_100)

## Correct rate for staying ~ 1/100
Rate_stay_100
## Correct rate for switching ~ 99/100
Rate_Switch_100

## I would NOT want to keep my first pick
## I would WANT to switch
```

What's going on here? 

#### Add your explanation below

We may notice a kee feature for this question.

1. If you make the RIGHT decision in the first time, then Case 1: you do not switch, then you win the prize (straightforward), and Case 2: you switch, then you lose the prize (as once you switch from the right decision, you can go nowhere but a goat)

2. If you make the WRONG decision in the first time, then Case 1: you do not switch, then you will see the goat (straightforward) and Case 2: you swith, then you win the prize (as all the wrong answers have been rule out)

So by the property of probability,

$$P(Correct|Stay) = P(Correct|Stay, First correct) * P(First correct|Stay)$$
$$+ P(Correct|Stay, First NOT correct) * P(First NOT correct|Stay)$$

and the result will be calculated as 1/3, which matches our result in simulation.
